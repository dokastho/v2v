# v2v
this repo is not under development

vehicle-to-vehicle transmission app, tested in Docker
## Notes on what the library should be capable of
* complete abstraction of payload
* transmission of data without any need for the user to manage reliability of transmissions
* handle faults/drops
* instantiated as a class object?
